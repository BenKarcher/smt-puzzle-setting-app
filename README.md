# SMT Puzzle Setter

A modular web-based puzzle setter with MiniZinc constraint solving. Create and solve logic puzzles with variant rules by mix-and-matching constraint definitions.

## Features

- **Grid Geometry Selection**: Choose from common presets (Sudoku 9x9, 6x6, 4x4, Latin Squares) or create custom rectangular grids
- **Flexible Solution Spaces**: Mix and match variable types:
  - Numbers in all cells
  - Numbers in some cells
  - Cell shading (black/white)
  - Lines through cell centers (loop puzzles)
  - Lines on cell edges
- **Modular Rule System**: Combine global and local rules to create complex puzzle variants
- **Pure Client-Side**: All solving happens in the browser using MiniZinc WASM
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new rules without modifying core code

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies

## How It Works

### 1. Grid Selection
Users select a grid geometry from presets (Sudoku, Latin Square) or create a custom rectangular grid.

### 2. Solution Space Configuration
Choose what types of values can be placed:
- **Numbers (all cells)**: Every cell contains a number from a range (e.g., 1-9)
- **Numbers (some cells)**: Some cells have numbers, others are empty
- **Shading**: Cells can be shaded or unshaded
- **Lines**: Draw loops or paths through/around cells

### 3. Puzzle Editor (Coming Soon)
- Place clues (given values)
- Add global rules (apply to entire grid)
- Place local rules (apply to specific cells/regions)

### 4. Solving
The compiler combines:
- Grid dimensions
- Variable declarations
- Clue constraints
- Rule constraints

Into a complete MiniZinc model, which is solved using the Gecode or Chuffed solver in WASM.

## Rule System

### Rule Definition Format

Each rule lives in `src/rules/[type]/[rule-name]/`:

**metadata.json**:
```json
{
  "id": "no-adjacent-shading",
  "name": "No Adjacent Shading",
  "description": "No two shaded cells may touch orthogonally",
  "type": "global",
  "requiredVariables": ["shading"],
  "categories": ["shading"],
  "parameters": []
}
```

**constraint.mzn**: MiniZinc constraint code
```minizinc
constraint forall(r in ROWS, c in COLS) (
  if r < rows then
    not (shaded[r, c] /\ shaded[r+1, c])
  else
    true
  endif
);
```

### Available Rules

#### Global Rules
- **Sudoku Standard**: Rows, columns, and boxes all different
- **Latin Square**: Rows and columns all different
- **No Adjacent Shading**: Shaded cells can't touch orthogonally
- **Even Shaded**: Shaded cells must contain even numbers

#### Local Rules
- **White Dot**: Two cells differ by 1
- **Black Dot**: Two cells have a 2:1 ratio
- **Killer Cage**: Region sums to a value, all different

### Adding New Rules

1. Create a new directory: `src/rules/[global|local]/my-rule/`
2. Add `metadata.json` with rule definition
3. Add `constraint.mzn` with MiniZinc constraints
4. Import in `src/lib/rule-loader.js`
5. Refresh page - rule appears automatically!

**Example: Diagonal Constraint**

```bash
mkdir -p src/rules/global/diagonal
```

`metadata.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "diagonal",
  "name": "Diagonal Constraint",
  "description": "Both main diagonals contain all different numbers",
  "type": "global",
  "requiredVariables": ["numbers-all"],
  "categories": ["uniqueness", "diagonal"]
}
```

`constraint.mzn`:
```minizinc
% Main diagonal all different
constraint alldifferent([numbers[i, i] | i in 1..min(rows, cols)]);

% Anti-diagonal all different
constraint alldifferent([numbers[i, cols-i+1] | i in 1..min(rows, cols)]);
```

Then add to `rule-loader.js` and it's ready to use!

## Technology Stack
