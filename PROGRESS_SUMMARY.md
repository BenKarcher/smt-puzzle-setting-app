## üìä Statistics

- **Lines of Code**: ~3000+ (estimated)
- **Components**: 7 Svelte components
- **Rules**: 10 defined (7 global, 3 local)
- **Grid Presets**: 5 (Sudoku 9x9, 6x6, 4x4, Latin 6x6, 9x9)
- **Variable Types**: 5 (2 active, 3 disabled)

## üéØ Current Status

**The puzzle setter is fully functional for:**
- Creating Sudoku puzzles with auto-rules
- Creating Latin Square puzzles
- Creating number + shading puzzles with even-shaded rule
- Solving puzzles with MiniZinc
- Viewing generated MiniZinc code
- Canvas-based editing with regions

**Next milestone:**
Complete the rule selector UI and constraint instance management to allow users to add local rules (killer cages, dots, etc.) to their puzzles.

## üêõ Known Issues

None currently! The basic puzzle setter is working well.

## üí° Design Decisions

1. **Canvas over Divs**: Better for drawing lines and complex graphics
2. **Chuffed as default solver**: Better performance than Gecode
3. **Regions drive thick borders**: Flexible system for any region-based puzzle
4. **Template-based local rules**: Powerful and flexible for complex constraints
5. **Separate setting/solving data**: Clear distinction between givens and work
6. **Pure client-side**: No backend needed, works offline

## üöÄ How to Test Current Features

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:5173/
3. Click "Run Test" to verify MiniZinc works
4. Select Sudoku 9x9 preset
5. Choose "Numbers in all cells" + "Cell shading"
6. Enter some clues in setting mode
7. Mark some cells as shaded
8. Click "Solve Puzzle"
9. View solution and MiniZinc code!

The app is ready for daily puzzle creation! üéâ
